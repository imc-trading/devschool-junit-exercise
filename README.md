# Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to gain some familiarity with Junit5 and AssertJ assertions. This is achieved by
getting you to write some simple tests.

To complete this exercise, simply replace the `fail(...)` statements with appropriate assertions in line with the `TODO`
comments in each failing test in [OrderEventStoreTest.java](./src/test/java/com/imc/school/OrderEventStoreTest.java).

## Prepare your environment

This project uses Maven to run the tests. You will need to install Maven and have a JDK 21 installed.
Instructions on installing Maven can be found here:
[Installing Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

## Run the tests

To run the tests you can use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

They are failing. Add the appropriate assertions and make the tests pass.
